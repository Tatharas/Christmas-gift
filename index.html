                You are <strong>my first and my last thought of the day</strong>.
                You quietly took over my wallpaper and my lock screen.
                You heal me — in real life and in game —
                and calm the storm in my head.

                You live in my heart and in my mind,
                at the same time… always.

                Loving you was never loud.
                It happened slowly, in the smallest moments,
                until you felt like something familiar…
                something safe.<br><br>

                I don’t expect anything from you.
                I never want to be a burden on your happiness.
                I just want you to know —
                somewhere in this world,
